# Binary-gap
Find the longest binary gap in between '1Â´ '1's by Python
"Find the longest sequence of zeros in the binary representation of an  given integer." a problem from: codility.com
A binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of N.

For example,  the binary representation of number 9 is 1001 and contains the  binary gap of length 2. The binary representation of number 529 is   1000010001 and has two binary gaps: one of length 4 another is length 3. The integer number 20 has the binary representation 10100 and has one binary gap and it's length is 1. The binary representation of number 15 is  1111 and contains no binary gaps. The binary representation of the integer number 32 is  100000 and contains no binary gaps.
